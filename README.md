# Project 1 of the PintOS project for CSE421: Operating Systems

PintOS is a small operating system, written in C, first developed at Stanford for usage in OS coursework. PintOS is deliberately missing several features, implemented by the student in non-contiguous projects. In CSE421, these projects were done in two-student teams. In my particular case, my teammate and I pair-programmed together remotely over Zoom due to Covid restrictions.

## P1 implements the following:
- Alarm Clock (no busy-waiting)
- Priority Scheduling 
- Priority Donation (prevent priority inversion)
- Multivel Feedback Queue Scheduler (4.4BSD Scheduler, activated with the "-mltq" kernel option)
